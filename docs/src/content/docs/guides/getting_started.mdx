<Steps>
    1. **Installation**
        <br/>
        BioShift can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using your favourite Python package manager (pip, uv, poetry, etc.). 
        You are very strongly recommended to use BioShift inside of a 
        [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
        This guide assumes you are familiar with how to use virtual environments in Python.

                pip install bioshift

                ```
                uv add bioshift
                ```
                See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/ for more information on using uv for python dependency management.

            <TabItem label="poetry">
                ```
                poetry install bioshift
                ```
                See https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#setting-a-python-version for more information on using poetry for python dependency management.
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="conda">
                If you are using conda to manage the dependencies for your project,
                you can install BioShift into your conda environment using
                `pip install bioshift`.
                <br/>
                Note that installing packages in a conda environment using pip can cause some issues; 
                please consult the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment)
                for more information on using PyPI packages in a Conda environment.

    2. **Usage**
        <br/>
        ```python
        import bioshift

        # Load a spectrum from a .ucsf file
        spectrum = bioshift.Spectrum.load('./nhsqc.ucsf')
        ```
</Steps>
